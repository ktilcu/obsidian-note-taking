# Note Taking in Obsidian

After reading Chris Krycho's excellent [blog post](https://v5.chriskrycho.com/journal/writing-down-what-i-do-in-obsidian/) on writing down what he does, I started the same practice. I have been doing it about 8 months now and it has proving super useful. During that journey i made some scripts that help me save time creating documents and links. The templates use a layout similar to Chris's.

## Requirements
Just the [Obsidian Templater Plugin](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater)
